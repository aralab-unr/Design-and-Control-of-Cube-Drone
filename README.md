For more details on the controller running on a resource-constrained microcontroller, please refer to our project: [SM-NMPC](https://github.com/aralab-unr/SM-NMPC).  
It includes instructions on generating the NMPC code for the Teensy 4.1, as well as the setup used for failure scenarios in the systemâ€™s stability tests.
